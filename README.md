Support Information

While every effort has been made to ensure that these modules are working as
 intended, there is no formal support.  These modules are intended to 
 provide examples and users should test thoroughly before using in their 
 environments.  The template module is provided for people to be able to 
 quickly implement their own functionality.
 
 If you do run into an issue please open an issue against the GitHub 
 repository and it will be resolved by one of the contributors.
 
 Feedback is always welcome, we hope you find these examples useful.
